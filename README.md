## What is Sudoku?
>Sudoku is a logic-based number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
## How to play sudoku (rules)
>The objective is to fill in the grid with digits from 1 to 9, making sure that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids, called "regions," contains all nine digits without any repetitions. You start with some initial numbers (clues) provided in the grid, and using logical deduction and elimination, you solve the puzzle by filling in the remaining empty cells, ensuring it adheres to the rules.
